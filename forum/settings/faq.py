**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**What kinds of questions can I ask here?**

Most importantly - questions should be relevant to this community. Before you ask - please make sure to search for a similar question. You can search questions by their title or tags.

**What kinds of questions should be avoided?**

Please avoid asking questions that are not relevant to this community, too subjective and argumentative.

**What should I avoid in my answers?**

OSQA: Open Source Q&A Forum is a question and answer site - it is not a discussion group. Please avoid holding debates in your answers as they tend to dilute the essense of questions and answers. For the brief discussions please use commenting facility.

**Who moderates this community?**

The short answer is: you. This website is moderated by the users. Karma system allows users to earn rights to perform a variety of moderation tasks

**How does the karma system work?**

When a question or answer is upvoted, the user who posted them will gain some points, which are called "karma points". These points serve as a rough measure of the community trust to him/her. Various moderation tasks are gradually assigned to the users based on those points.

For example, if you ask an interesting question or give a helpful answer, your input will be upvoted. On the other hand if the answer is misleading - it will be downvoted. Each vote in favor will generate |REP_GAIN_BY_UPVOTED| points, each vote against will subtract |REP_LOST_BY_DOWNVOTED| points. There is a limit of 200 points that can be accumulated per question or answer. The table below explains karma requirements for each type of moderation task.

* add comments ->  |REP_TO_COMMENT|
* delete comments -> |REP_TO_DELETE_COMMENTS|
* close own questions -> |REP_TO_CLOSE_OWN|
* reopen own questions -> |REP_TO_REOPEN_OWN|
* retag questions -> |REP_TO_RETAG|
* edit any answer -> |REP_TO_EDIT_OTHERS|
* open any closed question -> |REP_TO_CLOSE_OTHERS|
* delete any comment -> |REP_TO_DELETE_COMMENTS|
