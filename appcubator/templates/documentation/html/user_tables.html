<h2>User Tables</h2>

<p>User Tables define the different types of Users in your application. For example, you would want to define the two user tables on a forum, authors and commenters, or a community marketplace, buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>How do I create new User Tables?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A default user table has already been created for you with a list of properties.</p></li>
<li><p>When you type in a new User Role, it will automatically add a new User table with the default user properties, which can be customized.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to add properties, press the “add property” button, add your new property and define its type.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>How do I know if I need more than one User Table?</p>

<ul>
<li>A good rule of thumb is that if the user can perform different functions/access different materials than an existing one, then you    need to define a new user table. </li>
</ul>
