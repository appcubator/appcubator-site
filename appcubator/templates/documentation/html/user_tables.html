<h2>User Tables</h2>

<p><img src="{{STATIC_URL}}/img/tutorial/User_Table_2.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>On a forum, you have readers and moderators.</p>

<p>In a marketplace, buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>In a hospital, you have doctors, administrators, and patients.</p>

<p>These are examples of User Tables. Each has different data and pages.</p>

<ul>
<li>A default user table is created for you with a list of properties.</li>
<li>If you want to add properties, press the “add property” button, add your new property and define its type.</li>
</ul>

<p>How do I know if I need more than one User Table?</p>

<ul>
<li>A good rule of thumb is that if the user can perform different functions/access different materials than an existing one, then you need to define a new user table.</li>
</ul>
