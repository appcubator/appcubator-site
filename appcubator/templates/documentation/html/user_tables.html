<p>User tables define your different types of users who will log into your web application and will define the functions that they may perform.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On a forum, you have readers and moderators.</p></li>
<li><p>In a marketplace, buyers and sellers.</p></li>
<li><p>In a hospital eRecord, you have doctors, administrators, and patients.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are examples of User Tables. Each has a different set of data properties. You may also restrict Page access levels to a certain User.</p>

<p>How can I create User Tables?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To create a new user table, click on "add user table," type in the name of your new user table, and hit enter. </p></li>
<li><p>If you want to add properties, press the “add property” button, add your new property and define its type.</p></li>
<li><p>A default user table is created for you with a list of properties.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to add properties, press the “add property” button, add your new property and define its type.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Adding more User Tables:</p>

<ul>
<li>A good rule of thumb is that if the user can perform different functions/access different materials than an existing one, then you need to define a new user table.</li>
</ul>
