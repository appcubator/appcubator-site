<p>Text and links are very basic elements, but there are times when you want to drop a table or a dynamic list of elements. You may, for example, want to drop a list of apartment listings onto the page. If you already have a spreadsheet for apartment listings set up (see the Data and storage section), you'll see a "List of Apartment_listings" button on the panel. When you drop that onto the page, you'll be shown a window where you can edit how the list of apartments will look, and you can even filter down the list of apartments that are shown, ie show only the listings that belong to the currently logged in user.</p>
