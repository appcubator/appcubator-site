<h2>Domain Settings</h2>

<p>Domain names are the internet addresses of websites. Root domains are identified by their domain names (Ex. http://www.example.com) Subdomains are components of root domains that precede the domain name. (Ex. http://subdomain.appcubator.com)</p>

<p>Search Engine Optimization or SEO is used to ensure that your website can be found in search engines for words and phrases relevant to what the site is offering. </p>
