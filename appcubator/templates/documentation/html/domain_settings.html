<h2>Domain Settings</h2>

<p>Domain names are the Internet addresses of websites. Root domains are identified by their domain names with extensions such as .com, .org, etc., (Ex. http://www.example.com) Subdomains are components of root domains that precede the domain name. (Ex. http://subdomain.appcubator.com)</p>

<p>Search Engine Optimization or SEO is used to ensure that your website can be found in search engines for words and phrases relevant to what the site is offering, making it easier to connect with new users. </p>
