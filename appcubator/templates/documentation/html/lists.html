<h1>Lists</h1>

<p>Forms are what input information into your web applications. And Lists are what output the information from your web server. Without them, you can't enter or display data from your database. </p>

<p>When you enter a tweet into twitter, you are using a create form. When you see a list of your favorite celebrities tweets, you are using a list. </p>

<p>Display Existing Data </p>

<p>Lists display different records of entities based on the user specific database. Perfect for showing a twitter feed, comment board, or picture gallery.</p>

<ul>
<li>Drag and Drop a "List" from your "Table Data" sidebar. Every table that you have will have a List. </li>
</ul>

<p>How can I edit the information in my Lists?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Click "Edit Row" and drag and drop any of the buttons with the "+" icon from your "Row Context" edit bar to display additional user properties.</p></li>
<li><p>You will only be able to drag and drop your table properties into the green row. This row will be replicated in your entire list. </p></li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>What's Displayed?</p>

<ul>
<li>Click "Edit Query" to change the way that your list is sorted and how many rows are displayed to users. This will also change what is displayed in your list.</li>
</ul>

<p>When forms and lists come together on a page, you can actively enter and display your database.</p>
