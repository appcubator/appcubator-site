## UI Elements ##


The "UI Elements" toolbar provides you with your Authentication, Current User Entities, Table Data, and Design Elements. Just Drag and Drop what you need. If you're making your homepage, you will need Authentication Elements. If you are editing a "User Profile," you will rely on Current User and Table Data Entities.

When scaling the image, you can modify the style to maintain the dimensions by selecting either "img-width-fixed" or "img-height-fixed." "img-polaroid" will give a boardered look. Images can also be justified and padded using the Layout bar.
