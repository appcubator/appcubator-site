User tables define your different types of users who will log into your web application and will define the functions that they may perform.

- On a forum, you have readers and moderators.

- In a marketplace, buyers and sellers.

- In a hospital eRecord, you have doctors, administrators, and patients.

These are examples of User Tables. Each has a different set of data properties. You may also restrict Page access levels to a certain User.

How can I create User Tables?

- To create a new user table, click on "add user table," type in the name of your new user table, and hit enter. 

- If you want to add properties, press the “add property” button, add your new property and define its type.

- A default user table is created for you with a list of properties.

- If you want to add properties, press the “add property” button, add your new property and define its type.

Adding more User Tables:

- A good rule of thumb is that if the user can perform different functions/access different materials than an existing one, then you need to define a new user table.
