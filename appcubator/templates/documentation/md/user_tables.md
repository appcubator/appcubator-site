## User Tables ##



User Tables define the different types of Users in your application. For example, you would want to define the two user tables on a forum, authors and commenters, or a community marketplace, buyers and sellers.

How do I create new User Tables?

- A default user table has already been created for you with a list of properties.

- When you type in a new User Role, it will automatically add a new User table with the default user properties, which can be customized.

- If you want to add properties, press the “add property” button, add your new property and define its type.
 
How do I know if I need more than one User Table?

- A good rule of thumb is that if the user can perform different functions/access different materials than an existing one, then you 	need to define a new user table.
