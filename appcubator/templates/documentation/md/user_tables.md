## User Tables ##

![alt text](http://appcubator.com/static/img/tutorial/User_Table_2.png)

On a forum, you have readers and moderators.

In a marketplace, buyers and sellers.

In a hospital, you have doctors, administrators, and patients.

These are examples of User Tables. Each has different data and pages.

- A default user table is created for you with a list of properties.
- If you want to add properties, press the “add property” button, add your new property and define its type.

How do I know if I need more than one User Table?

- A good rule of thumb is that if the user can perform different functions/access different materials than an existing one, then you need to define a new user table.
