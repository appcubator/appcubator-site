## Relationships ##
 
Relations provide the links between your User Tables and Tables. 

Why are Relations important?

- Relations are important if you want to be able to assign a post to an author, product to seller, and a comment to a contributor.

How do I add Relations?

- Go to the “Relations” Section of “Tables” and select the relations that you need.

- Name the relations accordingly to how you would want it to read on your site if you were to have a “list of” 

- As you add each relation, they will aggregate in the “Relations” section.

When do I need to add a new relation?

- If you’re building a social network as in the documentation example, you’ll need to configure the relations between a “User <-> User,” “User <-> Post,” “User <-> Picture.” 

- Assigning relations between tables will occur in the examples of comments with posts, pictures, or product postings.

- They will also aggregate underneath the respective tables to allow you to easily keep track of your relations when you start adding more user roles.
