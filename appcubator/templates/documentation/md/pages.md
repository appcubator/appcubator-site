The pages screen is where you can add and organize pages for your application. 

How many Pages can I have?

- You can have as many as you want. For example, for a social network, you will need a homepage, registration page, account page and profile page. 

- You might also need a user-specific gallery or comment board.

How do I restrict access in my web application?

- When you create a new page, you should define its access level.

- For example, for a twitter feed, you might want to restrict the access level users only, or a specific type of user.
