How do I create a table?

- Press the “add table” button, name your new table and hit enter.

- If you want to add properties, press the “add property” button, add your new property and define its type.

How many tables do I need?

- A good rule of thumb for defining tables is if you want the users to store 'data' with a different set of properties, then you will need to define a new table. 

- For a community marketplace, a buyer would add products, and sellers would post comments.
