A "domain" is your own space on the web. Examples include "google.com" and "facebook.com".
You can claim your own appcubator subdomain - like john.appcubator.com - for free.

### How To Customize your Subdomain ###
- Go to "Change Subdomain" section of [app settings](/documentation/application_settings/) page.
- Type the domain you would like to have and press "Claim Subdomain" if it's available.

### How to Register a Custom Domain? ###

Prices for domain names range from $10 to $40 a year, and some more valuable ones are bought and sold on the market.
The simplest way to buy a domain is through a domain reseller, like Godaddy, Namecheap, and many others.

- Type the custom domain you would like to deploy your app on.
- Press “Register" and add any additional custom domains!
