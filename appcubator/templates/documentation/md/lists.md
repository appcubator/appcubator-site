Lists display different records of entities based on the user specific database. Perfect for showing a twitter feed, comment board, or picture gallery.

How can I edit the information in my Lists?

- Click "Edit Row" and drag and drop any of the buttons with the "+" icon from your "Row Context" edit bar to display additional user properties.

- You will only be able to drag and drop your table properties into the green row. This row will be replicated in your entire list.
