What is the Editor Toolbar?

- The "Editor" toolbar allows you to cycle between and edit your pages. 

- Remember to utilize the "Save" function often to record your progress. 

- The "Test Run" function allows you to deply your application to your custom domain or *.appcubator.com subdomain. 

Why should I be doing "Test Runs"

- You should be periodically using the Test Run button as you are building your application to make sure that your application is deploying correctly. This will also update the code on your live domain. 

- It is a good idea to test your build progress as you integrate more functionality into your web application.

How do I switch between pages?

- Click on the down arrow, to the right of the 'current page name' 

- This will toggle a drop bown menu which will list your current pages. 

- Click on "New Page" to name and create a new page.

How do I exit from the editor?

- Click on the 'left' arrow, to the left of the 'current page name' 

- This will toggle a drop bown menu which will list your tables, pages, email, and domain setting icons.
