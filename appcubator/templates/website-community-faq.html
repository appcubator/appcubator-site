          <strong>How customizable is Appcubator?</strong>
          <span>It is highly customizable. Appcubator is not a new language, or a bizarre wrapper around another language. It's a tool that converts visual inputs into a full stack web application that you'd normally write. So just start with the parts Appcubator provides and add your custom CSS, Javascript or Python code. We've put extra effort into making sure that this process is smooth.</span>
        </div>
        <div id="q-2">
          <strong>How portable is the generated code?</strong>
          <span>Very. Django is one a very popular web framework is supported by various hosting services such as AWS, Heroku and Dotcloud. Additionally, our generated code is completely human-readable, allowing a Python developer to easily look at the generated code and understand its details. In fact, there are few web consultancies using Appcubator to generate starter code for their projects.</span>
        </div>
        <div id="q-3">
          <strong>Do I own my data on Appcubator?</strong>
          <span>Absolutely. We give you full access to your data and provide with tools to browse it. You can download it anytime you want and the moment you delete your app, your data is also removed from our servers.</span>
        </div>
        <div id="q-4">
          <strong>Can I import my data/excel sheets on Appcubator?</strong>
          <span>Yep, we have a fully functional data browser built into your application. So once you create and deploy your application, you can go to the browser and upload your Excel Sheets. We support a variety of formats that include .xls and .xlsx</span>
        </div>
        <div id="q-5">
          <strong>What is the performance of sites hosted on Appcubator?</strong>
          <span>It will carry you a long way. Appcubator hosting can easily handle up to 1500 users and stay fast. Beyond that, you can easily move your system to AWS or Heroku. If you're on the premium plan, we can support this transition as well.</span>
        </div>
        <div id="q-6">
          <strong>How is Appcubator different from Weebly/Squarespace/Wix or other site builders?</strong>
          <span>Appcubator is not a *site* builder per se. It is an "application" builder that is designed to handle dynamic data and user input. They are all great services if you're building just a landing page and some static information about your company or yourself.</span>
        </div>
        <div id="q-7">
          <strong>Why don't you support other languages/frameworks?</strong>
          <span>We would like to! And we'll be working on it. We're currenlty focusing on perfecting the existing flow for building applications for you first. Once this is perfect, we will be able to focus on generating PHP or Rails applications as well.</span>
        </div>
        <div id="q-8">
