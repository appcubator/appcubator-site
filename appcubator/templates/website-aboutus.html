    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <div class="">
      <p>Web applications have come increasingly important, but they are not necessarily easier to build. For every executed web application, there are thousands of great ideas abandoned. Labeled as too complex, they are left to the specialists: the programmers and developers.  We saw that it was necessary to bridge this gap and created Appcubator to democratize software development.</p><br  />
       
      <p>Our product is not just for the aspiring MBA student who has a great startup idea; it’s for everyone, from the high school student who wants to build a marketplace for his school, to the developer who wants to reduce his build time.</p><br  />
       
      <p>Appcubator’s mission is to empower creative people with great ideas to build great things. Our approach is to built software with an intuitive, visual web platform that makes it effortless to code your own user-centric web application.</p><br  />
