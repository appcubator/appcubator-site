<p>You can think of an entity as an Excel spreadsheet. If you want to show a list of documents, for example, you need to have a `Document` entity. Any type of important informatino that is central to your application should have an entity likewise. Photo, Tweet, Post, Game are some very popular samples.
<br  />
After you identify important entities in your app, you should add their properties, just like the columns on an Excel table.
<br  />
Users are also entities, but they have exceptional properties.
