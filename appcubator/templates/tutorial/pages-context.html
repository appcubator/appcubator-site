<p>Some pages live at a URL you can clearly define, like "yoursite.com/registration_page".
Other pages are different though, because they have some data in the URL, which tells the website how to fill the page with content. For example, "yoursite.com/post/5" tells your site to show the page, filled with the data from the post with an ID of 5. You can do this by selecting "Post id" from the drop down on the URL screen *.</p>
<p>Rule of thumb: When you say "this is a page for a post" or "this is a page for a user profile", you know you need an ID in the url to tell the site which post or user profile it should use to fill the page with data.</p>
