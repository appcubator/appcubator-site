<h2>User Tables</h2>

<p>User Tables define the different types of User Roles. User Roles reflect the different types of users, and will define the functions that that user can perform. For example, you would want to define the differences between an author, and commenter on a blog/forum, or a buyer and seller on a community marketplace.</p>

<p>A default user table has already been created for you with a list of properties.</p>

<p>If you want to add properties, press the “add property” button, add your new property and define its type. If you want to add a profile picture </p>

<p>When adding user roles, a good rule of thumb is that if the user can perform different functions/access different materials than an existing one, then you need to define a new user role. 
When you type in a new User Role, it will automatically add a new User table with the default user properties, which can be customized.  </p>
