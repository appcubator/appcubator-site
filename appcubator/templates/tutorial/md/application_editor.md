When you drop a "Sign Up" or "Create" Form from the Authentication or Table Data sections of the UI Elements Editor, you have the option of editing these forms. The "Form Editor" allows you to customize labels, placeholders, display types for login fields, and form submission action. You can also configure which of the fields are required for user sign up.

- Edit fields - you can drag and drop the fields to reorder the signup options.


- Delete Fields - On mouseover of the fields, the orange delete symbol will appear allowing you to delete the form. 

- Form Submission - To change what happens when you submit your form, choose from one of the pages listed in your options section.

- Add a New Field - You can add a new field based on one of your table properties, or define a new field name and type. This will update your Table in the "Table Page." After you add your new field, treat it like any other field to edit.
